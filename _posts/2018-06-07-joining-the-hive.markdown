Back in May, I began my Professional Experience Year (PEY). PEY is a program offered by to University of Toronto that allows students with a technical background to work at a company for a full year (somewhat like an extended coop). I deceided that I would spend my PEY at Ecobee.

Around a decade ago, Ecobee started selling smart, wifi-enabled thermostats. These 'cool' devices can be programmed to set the temperature remotly. This way, people can avoid heating and cooling their houses during the houses of the day when no one is home and focus efforts into adjusting the temperature to be just right before you get home. With rising energy costs and the creaping problem of climate change, it wasn't long before people began to realize the importance of such products. Today, there are other smart thermostat that have entered the marketplace. Most notable of ecobee's competitors is Nest Labs - a company that was later bought by Google for $3.2 billion. Despite getting vastly outspent by its competitors, Ecobee has managed to stay a competitive player in the thermostat market thanks to its accurate measurment of temperature, developer friendly platforms and ease of use and support for customers.

Ecobee is a growing midsize company. Within the couple of weeks after I joined, the company recieved over 50 million dollars in funding from amazon, crossed the one million user threshold for the thermostats and surpassed the three hundred employee threshold. Now, with the recent launch of the switch+ lightswitch, ecobee is planning to expand past thermostats into the world of smart connected homes. I think that spending a year at a company of this size and stature will help me learn and grow as a developer. Moving past the thermostat, ecobee is now focusing on seperating services from the thermostat monolith into microservices that can scale laterally and be used alongside other products. With a growing number of users, its almost every week when we are thinking of how to facilitate the efficient transfer of large amounts of data. Ecobee is also starting to support a growing number of device, including the recent launch of the iPad app and prepares to improve them mobile app. With more platforms arise questions about how to maintain the best user experiece without sacrificing consistant behaviour across all devices. With the rise of connected homes, we have seen the interesting

When joining ecobee, all new employees at ecobee attend a set of manditory training workshops. These workshops serve as a great opportuninty to meet people into the company, understand how the thermostat and lightswitch products operate, as well as gain insight into the general operating procedures at the company. In one unique workshop, I spent an afternoon shadowing customer support representatives. While listening in on the customer calls, couldn't help but think back to the Quarry Worker's Creed, stating:

> We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals

It's a reminder to all engineers to keep the bigger picture in mind. Ecobee's customer support team gets calls on almost all aspects of the thermostat and lightswitch products. While I was there, I heard calls about everything ranging from furnace problems, hardware defects and even how to interface with the out third party integrations, including apple homekit. This training does a good in setting up our understanding of our customer's desires.

My currenty role is as a fullstack web developer and hope to try a bunch of different things during my time at ecobee.
