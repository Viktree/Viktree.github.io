Final exams finished in April and since May I have started my Professional Experience Year (PEY). PEY is a program offered by to University of Toronto that allows students to work at a company for a full year (like an extended coop). This gives students a chance to apply some of what was learned in the classroom while getting an emersive experience at a company. I decided to spend my PEY at ecobee. 

About a decade ago, ecobee started making wifi-enabled thermostats that can be programmed to set the tempreture remotely. With such a thermostat, I can avoid heating/cooling my house during the hours of the day when no one is home. With the rising cost of energy and the creaping problem of climate change, it wasn't long before people started to realize the importance of such products. Today, there are many other smart thermostat that have entered the marketplace. Most notable of these competitors is Nest Labs - a company that was later bought by Google for $3.2 billion. I think its really amazing that ecobee is able to remain competitive where companies like Nest and Honeywell regularly outspend them.

One thing that I really want to be able to do during my PEY is to learn how to write code that scales.

All new employees at ecobee attend a set of of manditory training workshops. These workshops serve as a great opportuninty to meet people into the company, understand the thermostat and lightswitch products, as well as gain insight into the general operating procedures at the company. In one unique workshop, I spent an afternoon listening in on customer support calls made to our call center. With this training, employees, like myself, improve our understanding of our customer's desires and keep this in mind in all things we do.

Things that drew me in:

- Third party integrations
- Company can compete when its underfunded
- Company works at scale

During our training for joining the company, we 



Only a few weeks in, and I have already feel like I am well into the grove of things.

- What is a typical workday like?
- What courses best prepared me for the work so far?
