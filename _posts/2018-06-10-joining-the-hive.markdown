Back in May, I began my Professional Experience Year (PEY). [PEY](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/ugrad/pey.htm) is a program offered by to University of Toronto allowing students with a technical background to work at a company. This is analagous to the co-op programs in other Canadian universities (except that its one year long). I deceided that I would spend my PEY at [Ecobee](https://www.ecobee.com/).

Around a decade ago, Ecobee started selling smart, wifi-enabled thermostats. Unlike the other thermostats at the time, 'ecobees' can be programmed to set the temperature remotly. This way, people can avoid heating and cooling their homes during hours of the day when no one is home and instead try to adjust the temperature to be where you want it half-an-hour before you get home. With rising energy costs and the creaping problem of climate change, it wasn't long before people began to realize the importance of such products. Today, there are other smart thermostats that have entered the marketplace. Most notable of Ecobee's competitors is [Nest Labs](https://nest.com/ca/) - a company that was later bought by Google for $3.2 billion. Despite getting vastly outspent by many of its competitors, Ecobee has managed to stay a competitive player in the thermostat market thanks to its accurate measurment of temperature, developer friendly platforms and ease of use and support for customers.

The company has started to use numerous bee related metaphores. The main office of Ecobee, seen above, is colloqually called as 'the hive' (This is not to be mistaken with Hive, one of our competitors).

Ecobee is a growing midsize company. Within a couple of weeks after I joined, the company recieved over 50 million dollars in funding from amazon, crossed the one million user threshold for the thermostats and surpassed the three hundred employee threshold. Now, with the recent launch of the switch+ lightswitch, Ecobee is planning to harness growing IoT demands and expand past thermostats into the world of smart connected homes.

I believe that spending time at a company of this size and stature will help me learn and grow as a developer. Expanding past the initial product of thermostats yeilds a new and exciting set of concerns for the company. Structurally, Ecobee is now focusing on seperating services from a thermostat monolith into sepereate microservices that can scale laterally. With a growing number of users, its almost every week when we are thinking of how best to facilitate the efficient transfer of large amounts of data. Ecobee is also starting to support a growing number of device, including the recent relaunch of the iPad app and prepares to improve them mobile app. More platforms raises more questions about how to maintain the best user experiece and how best to transfer information to our devices and with third party vendors. This means that tradeoffs need to be considered when approching questions of maintaining consistant behaviour across all platforms. Its challenges like these that will be ever present when aiming to developing good stable software. Challenges that I find are often easier to understand as a worker bee at 'the hive' than through a courses at university.

I was blown away by the training Ecobee had for new-hires and co-ops (including me!). Dispursed within your first month at Ecobee, all 'new bees' attend a set of manditory training workshops. These workshops serve as an opportuninty to meet people into the company, understand how the thermostat and lightswitch products operate, as well as gain insight into the general operating procedures values here at the company.

In one unique workshop, I spent an afternoon shadowing customer support representatives. While listening in on the customer calls, couldn't help but think back to the Quarry Worker's Creed, stating:

> We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals

The Quarry Worker's Creed a remindes us engineers to keep the bigger picture in mind when developing a product. The customer support team gets calls on almost all aspects of the thermostat and lightswitch products. While I was there, I heard calls about everything ranging from furnace problems, hardware defects and even how to interface with the out third party integrations like apple homekit. This training does a good in setting up our understanding of our customer's desires. It has a huge impact on the features we prioritize and the overall designs of our products. In one iteration, the desginers at Ecobee were pushing for a sleaker user interface (UI). After the design got released, our customer support was flooded with calls about confusion on this new design. As a designers sat in on the training, they were able to better realize the delicate balence that goes into a sleak UI without compramizing user experience.

Like Spotify, software teams at 'the hive' are organized using [Chapters, Squads and Guilds](https://medium.com/project-management-learnings/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761). Chapters are a groups of people that have similar roles with witin the company. They tend to meet once a week to discuss similar problems faced within the squads. On the other hand, squads are a group of people working on a particular feature, product or service. Each squad may have people with all sorts of different backgrounds. For example, there is a LightSwitch squad that works on developing the Switch+. This squad might have electrical engineers, programmers, designers and marketers. When it comes to desigining the lighswitch, the designers might find use in meeting with other designers around to comapny to discuss processes and best practices. Lastly, guilds are a means of organizing beyond the traditional roles in the company. Some guilds are formal, like guild-kotlin, which aims to promotes the use of the Kotlin programming language throughout the company. Others, are less formal, like the soccor-guild, which are a group of people that meet every week to play soccer.

Another nice thing at Ecobee are the 1-1s. Outside of all of the other structure described above, every week everyone has a dedicated half-hour of time to meet with their managers and have personal discussions about how things are progressing.

My currenty role is as a fullstack developer with the web chapter on an internal squad. During the first week, I spent time pair-programming with other menbers of my squad and exploring the codebase on my own. This helped me get up to speed quickly without either me or the senior developers having to worry about making sure I hadn't 'missed anything' as I was trying to get up to speed. By the time weeks two and three came arond, I was able to start writing code. Now I am able to look for things to work on myself with almost little guidence. My squad follows a agile methodology with daily standups and tight one week sprints.

One year is a long time, and I hope that I will have the opportunity to try out a variety of roles within Ecobee across many squads and guilds. For now I am going to keep trying to be the best I can bee.
